    <h2>Description</h2>
       <p>To make lasagna, start by preparing a meat sauce with ground beef, tomato sauce, 
       onions, and garlic, letting it simmer for full flavor. In a separate bowl, 
       mix ricotta cheese with egg and seasonings. In a baking dish, layer lasagna noodles, 
       meat sauce, ricotta mixture, and shredded mozzarella cheese, repeating until 
       the dish is filled. Finish with a layer of sauce and cheese on top, then bake at 375°F 
       for about 45 minutes, or until bubbly and golden.</p>
