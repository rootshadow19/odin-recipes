    <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>To make pizza, start by preparing a dough with flour, yeast, water, and salt, letting it rise until doubled. 
       Roll out the dough and place it on a baking sheet or pizza stone. 
       Spread a layer of tomato sauce over the dough, then add toppings like mozzarella cheese, pepperoni, and vegetables. 
       Bake in a preheated oven at 475°F for 10-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden and cheese is melted and bubbly.</p>
